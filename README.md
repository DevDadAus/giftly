An enhanced gift registry experience

My personal project for managing and maintaing gifts for Christmas and Birthdays.
Initial plan is to allow users to create a gift list that others can view and purchase and mark purchased so that the owner of the list does not know if it has been purchased, but other users can see that it was purchased.

Will use Java / Quarkus / Hibernate for the backend and React / JavaScript for the front end.
